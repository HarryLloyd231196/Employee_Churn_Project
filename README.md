<h1>Employee Churn Project</h1>
<h2> In progress . . . </h2>

## Introduction{#header-1}

This is a simple project showcasing an analysis of company employee data to highlight those at a high risk of leaving the company within the next 12 months. Completed as an assignment during my time studying at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University) in Melbourne, I have taken the time to revisit the work and improve upon the coding and presentation of the analysis.
