<h1>Employee Churn Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This is a simple project showcasing an analysis of company employee data to highlight those at a high risk of leaving <br />
the company within the next 12 months. Completed as an assignment during my time studying at the Royal Melbourne <br />
Institute of Technology (RMIT University) in Melbourne, I have taken the time to revisit the work and improve upon <br />
the coding and presentation of the analysis. <br />
